In many real-world situations, data does not come with clear labels or categories.

How do we uncover hidden structures, patterns, or groupings in such datasets?

Take a look at the provided dataset “Pyrolysis” (open in python or excel).

What meaningful insights, trends, or groupings can you find in this data by inspecting it manually?



Discussion:

- How easy or hard was it to find meaningful insights?
    ~ Could you find patterns or structures in the data.
    ~ Discuss any challenges you faced, such as data complexity, volume, or lack of labels.

- What methods did you use to explore the data?

- What if the dataset had even more features or rows?

- What is there was a way to automate this exploration without manual effort?
    ~ Unsupervised Learning!!
