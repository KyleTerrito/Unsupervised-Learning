# Unsupervised Learning: Exploring Hidden Patterns in Data 📊

## Welcome to the Lecture 🚀
Welcome to the **Unsupervised Learning** lecture series. In this lecture, we focus on methods that allow data to self-organize, uncover patterns, and reveal hidden structures—without the need for labeled guidance. This is a key area in machine learning that facilitates discovery and insight generation. 🕵️‍♂️🔍

### Lecture Overview 🤖🔬
This lecture will cover core unsupervised learning techniques that help extract meaningful patterns from data. Topics include:

✅ **Dimensionality Reduction** – Reducing data complexity while retaining important features through techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP.
✅ **Clustering** – Grouping similar data points together using algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
✅ **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)** – Mapping high-dimensional data into meaningful 2D representations.
✅ **Anomaly Detection** – Identifying unusual patterns and outliers within datasets.
✅ **Real-world Applications** – Look into some real world applications of unsupervised learning. 

### Why Unsupervised Learning? 🤷‍♂️
- Useful when labeled data is unavailable or expensive to obtain.
- Facilitates data exploration and pattern recognition.
- Aids in feature extraction and preprocessing for further analysis.
- Supports a variety of real-world applications, including customer segmentation, fraud detection, and bioinformatics.

### Get Started 🚀
To get started with the lecture materials, follow these steps:

#### Option 1: Using a Virtual Environment
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate into the project directory
cd <project-directory>

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# (Windows)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option 2: Using Anaconda
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate into the project directory
cd <project-directory>

# Create and activate a new Anaconda environment
conda create --name myenv python=3.8
conda activate myenv

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
